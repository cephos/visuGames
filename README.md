# visuGames

Small Collection of games that train visual abilities of 2-4 year olds. I'm writing them for our son who has some deficiencies with sight. 
Many games with that purpose exist as iPhone or Android-Apps that eather have a relatively high cost or contain adds, what we try to avoid. (As the games are rather simple to program)

A demo-Instance is available at https://visu.goetz.sg/

Best to be used with a tablet. 

To run: 
Install docker and docker-compose
git clone this repository. Then run it wich docker-compose up -d 

As configured in the docker-compose.yml the game is then playable under http://ipAddress:8423.

Built with phaser3 js-Game-Engine.
